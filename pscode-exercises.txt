// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers

# my pseudo codes

input num1
input num2
sum = num1 + num2
print sum

pick two numbers
add the two numbers together
print the sum of the numbers

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

ask for a number
check if input is odd or Even
if number is odd print "odd"
else if number is even print "even"

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

# my pseudo code 

a)user input numbers 1 - 5
b)average = the sum or the count
c)if the number is less than the minumum then minimun = number
  if the number is more than the maximum then maximum = number
d)print "The smallest number is minimum"
  print "The largest number in maximum
